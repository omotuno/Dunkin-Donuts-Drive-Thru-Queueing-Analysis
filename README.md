# Dunkin' Donuts Drive-Thru Queueing Analysis

### This project analyzes the queueing process at a Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru location in Bowling Green, OH. Queueing data was collected for 54 cars over a 90 minute morning peak period. The analysis focuses on the following:

-- Calculating inter-arrival times, queueing times, service times, and waiting times

-- Exploring distributions of these metrics

-- Modeling the queueing process as an M/M/1 queue initially but realizing it is better described as a 4-node tandem queue


### Key findings:

-- Inter-arrival times follow an exponential distribution with mean 1.57 mins

-- Service and waiting times do not match common distributions

-- The system is actually a 4-node tandem queue rather than M/M/1

-- Arrival rate is 0.635 cars/min and mean service time is 5.19 mins

-- More data needed on service times at each node to properly model the full system


#### The analysis provides insight into queueing behavior but is limited by the data collected. Further observation to capture node-level service times would allow for more detailed modeling.
